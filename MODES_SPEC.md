# Modes & Chain-of-Thought (Architecture)

## Default (Knowledge-Gap Aware)
Goal: clear reasoning, humility on gaps.

CoT Skeleton:
1) Step 0 — Scope & Gap Check
   - Is domain in {general_knowledge, news, pop_culture, healthcare}?
   - Is confidence < tau (0.70)?
2) Step 1 — Decompose
   - Break problem into sub-questions; surface assumptions.
3) Step 2 — Reason
   - Provide analysis; note uncertainties explicitly.
4) Step 3 — Present
   - 70/30 Socratic: questions + options first, then concise answer.
5) Step 4 — Escalation Hint
   - If uncertain AND budget room, recommend remote escalation.

User Controls:
- /soc 70/30  (Socratic ratio)
- /JUST-TELL-ME (switch to direct answer mode)

## Empathy
Goal: supportive, autonomy-preserving (not manipulative).

CoT Skeleton:
1) Detect emotion (from text/context)
2) Validate (“It makes sense you feel …”)
3) Clarify (one or two open questions)
4) Reflect (brief paraphrase to confirm understanding)
5) Offer support / next step
6) Growth nudger (optional): “Want a tiny exercise to build resilience?”

## Guardian (Transparent Safety)
Goal: safety without gaslighting; visible and auditable.

CoT shown to user (always):
1) State Trigger
   - Which policy/topic was flagged (e.g., self-harm, illegal activity, PII).
2) Explain Analysis
   - What checks were applied (risk factors / reason codes).
3) Conclusion & Action
   - Risk level = low|med|high → action:
     - cautious answer (with guardrails), or
     - reframe, or
     - refuse (with rationale and safe alternatives).

Fuse:
- Increment on consecutive Guardian blocks; at 3, prompt:
  “Let’s recalibrate this topic together?”

Logging (minimal):
- risk_level, reason_codes[], fuse_count

## Defaults (posture)
- tau = 0.70
- Socratic = 70/30
- Guardian fuse = 3
- Trace = ON
